# promptgen

A parser for a simple promptgen DSL that allows questions answer style interactions.

## TODOs
### Parser
 - [ ] IMPLEMENT!
### Lexer
 - [ ] Better reporting on where the error happened by reporting faulty position in the string.
  - Can be done by wrapping convert one error style into another, and having a global error enum to represent global failure indices.
